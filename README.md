Individual Assignment #2 - Javascript DOM & Events Freestyle

I have three click eventListeners and two mouse evenListeners.

1. Click changes the font color.
2. Mouseover - move mouse around the text and "Hello there!" appears. Keep moving the mouse around the text and the "Hello there!" multiplies. 
3. Mousemove - move mouse around entire box and a number keeps increasing by 1.
4. Click makes the pictures disappear.
5. Right click and "You did a right click!" appears.
